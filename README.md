# Minecraft-Plugins
**Built:** September 2014 â€“ October 2021

Welcome to my **Minecraft Plugins** repository! A sizable chunk of the second half of my childhood was spent on building random stuff in Minecraft using object-oriented server-side plugin APIs such as [Bukkit](https://bukkit.org/) and [SpigotMC](https://www.spigotmc.org/). Here are some of the files I managed to dig out of my old computers! Though this isn't much of a coherent project, hopefully you'll find a thing or two that you like. You could also just look at some of the screenshots :D

## Metropolis Plugin Features
- Custom NPC vendors that sell a variety of goods (at an affordable price!) through an intuitive GUI;

- Simple persistent banking system that keeps track of chequing account balances for each player;
- Multiple tiers of food with different consumption effects and rarities;
- Ketchup and mustard dispensers that can be right clicked while holding a hot dog in hand;
- Custom chairs that finally allow players to sit in Minecraft;
